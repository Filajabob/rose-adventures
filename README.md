# Rose Adventures

Choose your own adventure.

Note: We have a CLI (Command Line Interface), but we do not have a GUI (Graphical User Interface). A GUI may be coming.

## How to play

If you are viewing this in Replit, please ignore this section and simply press "Run"

---

You must have at least Python 3.6 to use. Install Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure you add Python to PATH.

This is not a tutorial on how to use Python or to run Python files. Please refer to other places to learn if you are not familiar with Python.

First, if you have git installed on your computer, open your terminal and clone the Github repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/Filajabob/rose-adventures
```

Otherwise, click on "Code" (the big green button in the repo page) and download. Unpack the ZIP.

If the terminal is not already open, open the terminal. Switch to the cloned repository with:

```
cd path/to/directory
```

Replace `path/to/directory` with the path to the cloned repository.

Run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

You may choose to enable colors, or disable them. If you enable colors, but instead of colors, you see weird cryptic text, stop the execution of the file with Ctrl+C and run the above command again, instead disabling colors.

At any time, if you want to exit out of the game, simply run Ctrl+C.
